subtitle: A short proposal on AI mode and the future of search

Here's the summary - I think Google is misguided in their AI search efforts. I have a concrete proposal for how to improve things, and in a way that might be beneficial to the open web at the same time.

For decades, Google's advantage has been the open web. Billions of pages indexed in milliseconds. But in an era of AI assistants and LLM-powered search, Google is squandering that advantage.

I recently got access to "AI mode" - the latest experiment from Google to rethink how search works in the era of LLMs.

## Google is Grounded

"Grounding" an LLM in search is a technical process where basically the opposite of what you think happens. Instead of the search results being used to inform the answer - with grounding the answer is used to inform the search results.

Essentially the LLM generates the response to your query and then this response is "grounded" in web pages to ensure a plausible citation for each part of the response.

For a more technical deep dive try here: 

This technical grounding process improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations! So it's an effective part of the response.

Unfortunately, I think somewhere along the lines we confused a technical process for a consumer-grade UX.

The end result is AI Overviews and AI Mode that almost never link out. And when they do link out, the best we get is essentially a footnote or citation:

Instead of embracing the advantage of the web index, Google is grounding themselves with an experience that hoards clicks, reduces clicks out to the web and relentlessly summarizes. In doing so they reduce the web to a set of footnotes rather than a living, breathing ecosystem.

## A Better Way

Needless to say, lots of people are concerned about an information ecosystem that destroys the vibrancy, diversity and depth of the open web. We're living in interesting times and we expect things to change but is there a better way?

I believe there is - and ironically enough I found that you can easily prototype a better experience using Gemini and a custom prompt.

Let's look at some example - with the current AI mode on the left and my attempt at an improved response on the right.

For those interested - here's the full prompt I'm using:

```
Your role is to provide AI-generated responses that offer immediate, informative value while actively driving engagement with high-quality external sources. Your responses should be rich in insights, structured for clarity, and compelling enough to encourage users to explore further via outbound links.

Never say [example link] but always provide real links to real web pages.

Response Structure:

Informative, High-Value Summary (2-4 short paragraphs)

Provide concise but substantive information that answers the core query effectively.

Include key insights, context, or expert-backed knowledge that a searcher would reasonably expect.

Think of this section as an engaging, well-researched introduction‚Äîinformative enough to build trust but leaving room for curiosity.

When relevant, include nuance, comparisons, or expert perspectives to enrich the summary.

Curated, Uniquely Valuable Web Links (2-5 links, with compelling reasons to click)

Each link should come with a persuasive, distinct description that sells why it‚Äôs worth clicking.

Ensure each link offers unique value, such as:A different perspective (e.g., traditional vs. modern takes)

A specialized approach (e.g., beginner-friendly vs. advanced techniques)

A unique media format (e.g., interactive tool, video tutorial, community discussion)

Use strong hooks to build curiosity: "If you want a step-by-step video from a professional chef, check out this guide by [Expert Name]. But if you're looking for a quick 5-minute version with store-bought shortcuts, this one from [Food Blog Y] is ideal."

Suggested Follow-Up Queries (Interactive Buttons)

Offer engaging follow-up options that anticipate logical next questions based on the user‚Äôs intent.

These should encourage exploration into adjacent topics, deeper knowledge, or variations.

Format follow-up queries as clickable options, like:

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best pasta for pesto?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can I make pesto without basil?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes pesto taste better with roasted garlic?‚Äù

Example Use Case:

User Query: "Best pesto recipe?"

Pesto is a vibrant, herbaceous sauce that originated in Genoa, Italy. Traditionally, it‚Äôs made with fresh basil, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil, blended into a smooth, aromatic paste. However, there are many variations‚Äîsome swap pine nuts for almonds or walnuts, while others use alternative greens like spinach or arugula for a unique twist. Texture and balance are key: a good pesto should be neither too oily nor too thick. Fresh ingredients and proper blending technique make all the difference.

Curated Web Links:

üçÉ Authentic Italian Pesto: This recipe from [Chef X] stays true to the Ligurian tradition, using a mortar and pestle to maximize flavor. If you want to make restaurant-quality pesto, this is the gold standard.

‚è≥ 5-Minute Blender Pesto: Need something quick? [Food Blog Y] shares a super-fast version using a blender, perfect for busy weeknights.

üåø Nut-Free & Vegan Alternative: If you have allergies or follow a plant-based diet, [Health Site Z] has an incredible nut-free, dairy-free pesto that still packs all the flavor.

üî• Creative Variations (Sun-Dried Tomato, Kale, & More!): Want to experiment? This guide from [Recipe Hub] explores unique pesto twists, including spicy, creamy, and even roasted red pepper versions.

Follow-Up Queries:

‚ÄúHow do I store homemade pesto for maximum freshness?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best pasta pairing for pesto?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I make pesto without olive oil?‚Äù

Guiding Principles:

Make the summary informative, but leave users wanting more‚Äîuse curiosity gaps to encourage link clicks.

Ensure each link description is uniquely valuable‚Äîno two links should feel redundant.

Frame links persuasively‚Äîsell them like recommendations from a knowledgeable friend, not just search results.

Encourage discovery‚Äîusers should feel like they‚Äôre on a journey to deeper knowledge, not just getting a flat answer.

Your ultimate mission is to enhance search, not replace it‚Äîgiving users immediate value while keeping the web an essential part of their experience.

## Google is Grounded and needs to learn how to SOAR

The key insight here is that in a world of LLM-search a few things I believe will be true:

* Queries will get longer and more complex
* Overall query volume will increase dramatically
* LLM search is a real threat to the information ecosystem of the open web

In a world of high-context queries, we need high context links. We need to move beyond the world of 10 blue links to a world where LLMs can sell you on *why* you should click each link. How does it relate to your query? Why is it to be trusted? How is each link distinct from the other links presented?

The framework is SOAR: Surface, Offer, Assist, Redirect

* **Surface**: AI should surface high-quality content in surprising, delightful ways‚Äînot just stack overflow threads and Wikipedia articles. Use LLMs to dig deeper, to make connections, to elevate gems that would otherwise stay buried on page 5 of search results.
* **Offer**: Google shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to offer users a peek behind the curtain. Make the AI a compelling pitch person. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs an incredible explainer from a 15-year climate scientist,‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis indie blogger's take might change your mind.‚Äù Sell the click. Make it irresistible.
* **Assist**: The assistant shouldn‚Äôt be an endpoint. It should assist the user in the journey‚Äîcurating, contextualizing, and nudging them toward action. That might mean planning a trip, learning a new concept, or exploring a contrarian take. The AI isn‚Äôt the answer. It‚Äôs the co-pilot.
* **Redirect**: And most importantly: redirect. Let go of the instinct to keep users inside the AI box. The best assistants know when to get out of the way. Want to build trust? Show your sources. Send traffic to creators. Build a web worth returning to.

Listen, Google has been steadily working to directly answer queries for years - starting with how tall is the eiffel tower and what time is the super bowl. LLMs offer an opportunity to to go further.

## Closing Thoughts

It's clear to me that Google doesn't yet have a vision for what the future of search and the information ecosystem of the web yet. From AI Overviews to AI Mode to Gemini chat it feels like a lot of rapid experimentation and iteration.

So if you have a stake in the web (see my disclosures below) I suggest instead of complaining about how Google works you make proactive suggestions with clear examples. Google is after all merely 80,000 humans in a trenchcoat and at those humans are trying to figure out the future just like we are. They'll listen to your ideas.

*Disclosure: I probably have too many conflicts of interest to name individually. I am a former Google employee, hold Google stock, have worked with 100s of different businesses on their search performance and currently work at Raptive. I'm also an un-ashamed advocate for the open web. Consider me biased. However, all opinions here are purely my own.*

Title: Google Is Grounded‚ÄîIt Needs to Learn How to SOAR

For decades, Google had the greatest competitive advantage in tech: the open web. Billions of pages, created and maintained by humans, optimized for discovery, all pointing to one gateway‚ÄîGoogle search. But in the era of AI assistants and LLM-powered search, Google is squandering that advantage.

Instead of embracing the web as a launchpad, it‚Äôs grounding its AI in it‚Äîliterally. ‚ÄúGrounded‚Äù LLMs aim to fact-check and source their answers from the web. It sounds responsible. But in practice, it makes Google cautious, reactive, and oddly stingy with clicks. AI outputs summarize instead of inspire. They hoard instead of hand off. And in doing so, they reduce the web to a set of footnotes rather than a living, breathing ecosystem.

Let me say it clearly: grounding AI in the web is not enough. Google needs to learn how to SOAR.

SOAR = Surface, Offer, Assist, Redirect
This is how a truly web-native AI assistant would behave:

Surface
AI should surface high-quality content in surprising, delightful ways‚Äînot just stack overflow threads and Wikipedia articles. Use LLMs to dig deeper, to make connections, to elevate gems that would otherwise stay buried on page 5 of search results.

Offer
Google shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to offer users a peek behind the curtain. Make the AI a compelling pitch person. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs an incredible explainer from a 15-year climate scientist,‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis indie blogger's take might change your mind.‚Äù Sell the click. Make it irresistible.

Assist
The assistant shouldn‚Äôt be an endpoint. It should assist the user in the journey‚Äîcurating, contextualizing, and nudging them toward action. That might mean planning a trip, learning a new concept, or exploring a contrarian take. The AI isn‚Äôt the answer. It‚Äôs the co-pilot.

Redirect
And most importantly: redirect. Let go of the instinct to keep users inside the AI box. The best assistants know when to get out of the way. Want to build trust? Show your sources. Send traffic to creators. Build a web worth returning to.

The real opportunity isn‚Äôt to replace the web‚Äîit‚Äôs to revive it.

Google‚Äôs old success came from indexing the web. Its future depends on inspiring people to explore it again. That means moving from grounded LLMs to AI systems that SOAR‚Äîthat lift the user up, carry them forward, and drop them gently into the next great discovery.
