New year, new me, new clients am I right?

I don't work with many clients. In 2023 I worked with 6 clients. In 2022 it was 4.

This is partly because I have the luxury to choose and partly because I really like to work with clients in a deep, transformational way.

One of my active clients I've been working with for 7 years.

Right now though I have some capacity for new clients and I'm trying to be thoughtful about not just attracting clients, but attracting the **the right kind of clients**.

How do I find the next 7-year client?

Well, if you don't ask you don't get right so here's some brands and projects I've love to work with in 2024:

## Figma

Figma has changed my life. I spend all day long staring at my glowing rectangle of a computer screen but what is *on* that screen has meaningfully changed in the last few years. Even though I'm not a designer and don't get hired for "design" work I spend 50%+ of my time in Figma.

A canvas is just a beautiful and useful place to think.

I've talked before about making [strategy maps](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/06/28/one-page-strategy/), [beautiful charts](https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1737153195237888061) and more in Figma. I even ran a cohort based course around non-design uses of Figma called [Figma Thinkers](https://figmathinkers.com/).

Much like the underlying javascript technology of ajax ushered in Gmail and with it a whole paradigm of "apps in the browser" I believe that the technical advances in making the open canvas work will usher in a whole new paradigm of canvas-based apps.

Relevant: [infinitecanvas.tools](https://infinitecanvas.tools/)

I'm such a fanboy that I'd work with Figma on anything ha. But here's a few ideas:

* Exploring non-design / non-product use cases for Figma. What if we built a new team inside Figma that aimed at winning over McKinsey and all the big consulting firms to use Figma day to day. What would that look like? How would the product need to evolve? How might we open up a whole new segment of the market?
* How can we do more interesting, adventurous editorial projects? Inspired by [Stripe press](https://press.stripe.com/) and [Figma essays](https://www.figma.com/file/IV5AGF2aV75vau327SUKSy/CRYPTO-PHILANTHROPY?node-id=0%3A1&utm_source=figmathinkers&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=figma-thinkers-week-8-creative-figma-uses). How might we explore a wider, more creative range of publishing and editorial projects to show off what Figma can do?
* From an SEO perspective, Canva has done a masterful job with templates, tools and content designed for SEO and gets... *checks notes*... about 3400% more Google traffic[^figma]. What would the Figma equivalent SEO play be here?

## Replit

Tinkering with the web is a foundational part of my identity. I've called this [digital bricolage](https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/01/20/digital-bricolage/) before. I'm not a real developer, just like I'm not a real designer and yet I build things on Replit all the time!

I'm a huge advocate for tools that lower the bar to entry for more users and help people expand what they think is possible. Couple that with a deep frustration at how most developer tools on board users (see: [why can't I code inside my browser](https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/14/new-browsers/)) and Replit is a dream client.

I recently build a little bookmarklet and app for a client using Replit that gave an x-ray vision overlay on their website with a bunch of custom analysis and stats - took me a few hours to prototype and opened up a bunch of interesting conversations! I love that kind of thing.

So how might we work together? Some ideas:

* Replit has a real search problem - if you search for examples and templates on Google you get stuck in a list of Replit pages that look the same, with many of them being low-quality. There's a crawling, architecture and internal linking strategy here to dramatically improve the ability for people to find high quality Replit examples and templates.
* You can import Github repos directly into Replit which feels like magic when it works! Except it's very hard to know if it's going to work ahead of time. I think there are opportunities here around better messaging / workflows / community standards to help people better understand whether a github repo can be imported directly into Replit, and if so how to do it.
* The education play on Replit seems very successful with the 100 days of code in particular. I'd love to expand this idea into potentially more cohort-based models of building projects. Less "learn to code" and more "build something interesting, together".

## Remarkable

I bought a Remarkable tablet last year and it really changed my daily knowledge work. It's a beautiful product that feels like a joy to use. It's also directly led to me reading a *lot* more PDFs and academic papers - it's such a perfect form factor for loading up a PDF and reading/annotating - deep focus work away from my other screens.

At the same time - it's clearly still early in the "e-ink screen" world, it feels kind of like when I got my first Sonos product 12 years ago. Such a leap forward ahead of everything else but also kind of clunky, we're still working our way through what this technology can and should do and how we interact with it.

Some things I'd love to work with Remarkable on:

* They've done a great job with Instagram content - it's polished, engaging and clearly converts for them. But remarkable.com is somewhat neglected in terms of content. There's a big opportunity to really take the web seriously and build an evergreen content library - both to show off the product and to do a better job on the product education and support side.
* When I'm working on my laptop I keep my Remarkable right next to me but this "passive second screen" use case is completely unexplored. I'd love to work through how you could enable new modes of working - what could you use your e-ink second screen for? There are all kinds of [kindle jailbreak](https://github.com/dennisreimann/kindle-display) and [raspberry pi examples](https://github.com/speedyg0nz/MagInkCal) of second-screens and displays that I think the Remarkable would be perfect for.
* While generally the Remarkable UX and interactions are well thought through there are a variety of things that would be fun to prototype and play with for example double-tap the power button to take a screenshot, or an "send this" action when you select a region.
* I'd love to explore different workflows and innovations around web <--> remarkable workflows for saving, reading, sharing content between the browser and the device. There's lots of unexplored uses here.

Oh, and when are we getting a Google Calendar integration? :)

## Stripe

I use Stripe almost every day. Both as a consumer and as someone who sells things on the internet. Stripe is an astonishing service that has no right to be as polished, playful and fun to work with as they are.

And they have beautiful web-design! and they have a writing culture! and they have a whole experimental content/publishing approach!

How might we work together? Some thoughts:

* Stripe press is incredible in terms of their brand but still fairly limited in scope. I'd love to get involved with Stripe and see what their focus on writing culture can do for the web.

## LinkedIn

A personal learning environment for all. Ping me if you want a copy of the deck!

## More Weird Indie Collabs

I learned to love Figma because of my collaboration with Toby. I learned to love brand because of my collaboration with Elan. Collaborating with other indies are some of my most generative and growth projects I've worked on.

## University Collabs

I've taught at a b-school and I've taught at ITP. ITP was far more fun haha.

I'd love to teach innovation, business, management.

## More Strategic Advisor Roles

I spoke with a fellow indie consultant - their default engagement model involved being chair of the weekly management meeting and then running the quarterly planning sessions. I've been touching on a lot more of this kind of work and would love to formalize it with a few clients.



But I thougt 

Figma - expanding the idea of use cases outside of design. New ideas around consultants, canvas based thinking and more.

Replit - solving their search problem. I think there are some big ambitious ideas here like what if they auto-generate 10,000 pages for the top github projects to check compatability? How do they prevent spam and low-quality replits being indexed by Google? How do you build the right feedback loops between community and content to ensure a growing high quality index of replits?

An RSS institution - is this Automattic? Mozilla? NYPL? Always dreamed of kickstarting an RSS revival - a set of work and funding around RSS because it's inherently decentralzied and uncommercial but there's lots of innovation left to do!

LinkedIn - content / learning / education, the network with the most potential is LinkedIn, I have a vision for a personal learning network and how LinkedIn could transform education AND social media.
