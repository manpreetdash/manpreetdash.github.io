New year, new me, new clients am I right?

I don't work with many clients. In 2023 I worked with 6 clients. In 2022 it was 4.

This is partly because I have the luxury to choose and partly because I really like to work with clients in a deep, transformational way.

One of my active clients I've been working with for 7 years.

Right now though I have some capacity for new clients and I'm trying to be thoughtful about not just attracting clients, but attracting the **the right kind of clients**.

How do I find the next 7-year client?

Well, if you don't ask you don't get right so here's some brands and projects I've love to work with in 2024:

## Figma

Figma has changed my life. I spend all day long staring at my glowing rectangle of a computer screen but what is *on* that screen has meaningfully changed in the last few years. Even though I'm not a designer and don't get hired for "design" work I spend 50%+ of my time in Figma.

A canvas is just a beautiful and useful place to think.

I've talked before about making [strategy maps](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/06/28/one-page-strategy/), [beautiful charts](https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1737153195237888061) and more in Figma. I even ran a cohort based course around non-design uses of Figma called [Figma Thinkers](https://figmathinkers.com/).

Much like the underlying javascript technology of ajax ushered in Gmail and with it a whole paradigm of "apps in the browser" I believe that the technical advances in making the open canvas work will usher in a whole new paradigm of canvas-based apps.

I'm such a fanboy that I'd work with Figma on anything ha. But here's a few ideas:

* Exploring non-design / non-product use cases for Figma. What if we built a new team inside Figma that aimed at winning over McKinsey and all the big consulting firms to use Figma day to day. What would that look like? How would the product need to evolve? How might we open up a whole new segment of the market?
* How can we do more interesting, adventurous editorial projects? Inspired by [Stripe press](https://press.stripe.com/) and [Figma essays](https://www.figma.com/file/IV5AGF2aV75vau327SUKSy/CRYPTO-PHILANTHROPY?node-id=0%3A1&utm_source=figmathinkers&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=figma-thinkers-week-8-creative-figma-uses). How might we explore a wider, more creative range of publishing and editorial projects to show off what Figma can do?
* From an SEO perspective, Canva has done a masterful job with templates, tools and content designed for SEO and gets... *checks notes*... about 3400% more Google traffic[^figma]. What would the Figma equivalent SEO play be here?

## Replit



## Remarkable

I've been circling the tools for thought space for a long time. But I love my remarkable tablet. They 

They've found incredible success with Instagram but have almost zero traffic on their website. Content strategy and SEO could be foundational to them.

"remarkable 2 calendar" is the top keyword to the blog (it doesn't have a calendar...)

Also - would love to run some product innovation ideas. Readwise integration, better website integration, calendar notebooks and more.

## Stripe

Stripe press is incredible in terms of their brand but still fairly limited in scope. I'd love to get involved with Stripe and see what their focus on writing culture can do for the web.

## LinkedIn

A personal learning environment for all. Ping me if you want a copy of the deck!

## More Weird Indie Collabs

I learned to love Figma because of my collaboration with Toby. I learned to love brand because of my collaboration with Elan. Collaborating with other indies are some of my most generative and growth projects I've worked on.

## University Collabs

I've taught at a b-school and I've taught at ITP. ITP was far more fun haha.

I'd love to teach innovation, business, management.

## More Strategic Advisor Roles

I spoke with a fellow indie consultant - their default engagement model involved being chair of the weekly management meeting and then running the quarterly planning sessions. I've been touching on a lot more of this kind of work and would love to formalize it with a few clients.



But I thougt 

Figma - expanding the idea of use cases outside of design. New ideas around consultants, canvas based thinking and more.

Replit - solving their search problem. I think there are some big ambitious ideas here like what if they auto-generate 10,000 pages for the top github projects to check compatability? How do they prevent spam and low-quality replits being indexed by Google? How do you build the right feedback loops between community and content to ensure a growing high quality index of replits?

An RSS institution - is this Automattic? Mozilla? NYPL? Always dreamed of kickstarting an RSS revival - a set of work and funding around RSS because it's inherently decentralzied and uncommercial but there's lots of innovation left to do!

LinkedIn - content / learning / education, the network with the most potential is LinkedIn, I have a vision for a personal learning network and how LinkedIn could transform education AND social media.
