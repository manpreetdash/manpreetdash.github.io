Figma - expanding the idea of use cases outside of design. New ideas around consultants, canvas based thinking and more.

Replit - solving their search problem. I think there are some big ambitious ideas here like what if they auto-generate 10,000 pages for the top github projects to check compatability? How do they prevent spam and low-quality replits being indexed by Google? How do you build the right feedback loops between community and content to ensure a growing high quality index of replits?

An RSS institution - is this Automattic? Mozilla? NYPL? Always dreamed of kickstarting an RSS revival - a set of work and funding around RSS because it's inherently decentralzied and uncommercial but there's lots of innovation left to do!

LinkedIn - content / learning / education, the network with the most potential is LinkedIn, I have a vision for a personal learning network and how LinkedIn could transform education AND social media.
