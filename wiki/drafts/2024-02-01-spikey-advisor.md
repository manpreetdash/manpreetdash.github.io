There are many situations where companies don't have the budget or the bandwidth for a full consulting engagement. In these situations it's tempting to reach for a coaching or advisor model. Something like "a one hour phone call every other week".

I don't like this model so I've built a new model that works better. It's called being an **active advisor**.

A good advisor creates clarity and creates momentum.
A bad advisor confuses and slows.

Typically "ideas" is not what you want. You want clarity and momentum. The ability to get shit done, and to help everyone understand what needs to be done. Clarity and momentum.



## Consulting Is Not Smooth

Working with companies it's not linear, there are moments where lots happens. Chronos and Kairos.

## The Model of Active Advising

Here are the principles that I find works:

1. Go to the work. Beyond just talk - open the doc, fire up analytics, get *in* the work.
2. Get close enough for context. One phone call a week doesn't give enough context and you don't want to spend the time 
3. Room to ramp up and down. The engagement shouldn't be billed hourly to enable fluid ramp up/down for context



## Example:

What started with DoubleLoop as simple "advising" became much more hands on at critical moments e.g. bulding their new website in Framer.

Anyway, I'm prototyping this kind of "active advisor" role for $6-8k / month. Ping me if you want to try it out.





This is kind of a standard model but it doesn't work for me.

But there are many si

I've been called many things: consultant, growth advisor, coach, partner, 

As gig work gets more popular there is increasingly codified approaches to the types of gig work:

And here's a great interview with Elena Verna: https://medium.com/@s16vc/elena-verna-how-to-leverage-advising-for-the-growth-of-your-company-3662bcd6180e

Let's complicate this a little more because I don't think it's so clear cut. Maybe the reality is something a bit more like this:

2x2

Actually - let's complicate this *even more* because a typical consulting project might span several years and vary across *all* of the map!!

In one "consulting" engagement I might fluctuate between:

- An hour long phone call once a week
- 4 days in the office leading a team
- Attending quarterly executive meetings
- 

Here's the rub though: these labels don't map very well to the lived experience of doing independent work for companies.

There's more transition, more gray area more nuance and so on.

## Active Advising

In my work I've floated across the whole spectrum 

The active advisor.

Where we don't just talk - we do.

Move the conversation to where the work is.

Is there some analogy for how momentum doesn't happen eavenly?

DoubleLoop -> advisory + spikey burst of videos etc
Finder -> advisory + spikey projects

(spike is an agile PM term?)
