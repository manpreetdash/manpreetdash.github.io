My buddy Luke recently started a band called Tattoo Mustache. While we were chatting his eyes lit up talking about jamming in the studio with his bandmates - his arms were flailing and you could feel the energy coming from him. These weekly jam sessions are something magical - *"You can just rent a studio for 3 hours for like $150 and they have a drum kit and keyboard and everything!"*.

What does starting a band have to do with working from home?

* 2016 - 2020: Consistently in client offices 3/4/5 days a week
* 2020 - 2021: 18 month covid road trip with the family
* 2022 - 2024: Consistently wfh 4/5 days a week

I've marked the wfh era red because... well it lines up pretty well with when I started feeling stuck.

I was like a corporate nomad - drifting from client office to client office.

## Dimensions of Loneliness

Types of socializing:

* Belonging: I feel like part of a crew
* Support: Hey I'm stuck on something can I talk it through with you?
* Jam sessions: Hey let's jam on this thing together
* Serendipitous socializinng
* Micro human interactions
* Looking over someone's shoulder
* Serendipitous introductions (someone comes for a meeting of some sort and you're like "Oh, while you're here you should meet Tom...")
