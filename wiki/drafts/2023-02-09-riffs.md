Writing on the internet is a superpower, but it can feel difficult - it can feel *heavy*. In this post I want to talk specifically about a format for writing that is deliberately designed to be easy to write, while being designed to create connection (not pageviews).

## First, make your writing small

I've written about my small-b blogging philosophy before:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Small%20b%20blogging" data-author="@tomcritchlow" cite="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/">
<p>Instead - I think most people would be better served by subscribing to small b blogging. What you want is something with YOUR personality. Writing and ideas that are <strong>addressable</strong> (i.e. you can find and link to them easily in the future) and <strong>archived</strong> (i.e. you have a list of things you’ve written all in one place rather than spread across publications and URLs) and <strong>memorable</strong> (i.e. has your own design, logo or style). Writing that can live and breathe in small networks. Scale be damned.</p>

<p>When you write for someone else’s publication your writing becomes disparate and UN-networked. By chasing scale and pageviews you lose identity and the ability to create meaningful, memorable connections within the network.</p>

This kind of small writing is essential to create connection. You're not writing from a place of authority, you're writing from a place of curiosity. Open writing, not closed writing.

## Riffs are for relationships

The unit of blogging is the conversations not pageviews. A good blog post in my mind sparks interesting [subterranean conversations](https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/05/29/underground-blogging/).

## Content as a gift

The wrong way to think about this is blasting your content at people. The right way is to think of it as a gift.

Steinbeck wrote this way:

Forget your generalized audience. In the first place, the nameless, faceless audience will scare you to death and in the second place, unlike the theater, it doesn’t exist. In writing, your audience is one single reader. I have found that sometimes it helps to pick out one person—a real person you know, or an imagined person and write to that one.

While I'm writing a blog post in drafts I'll add a little note like [^outreach]:

[^outreach]: Yep, you guessed it this is actually the list of people I sent this post to!


## Show the sawdust, leave the threads

Show the sawdust means

Leave the threads

Ok, so since this post is a riff. Here's some provocations:

- Do you need a system like a personal CRM? [Khe does](https://radreads.co/mutually-beneficial-intro/) and he [walks the walk](https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1296872388152492039).
- It doesn't feel to me like you can do this without hosting the writing on a URL - I default to my blog but I'm betting Notion / Google Docs would work just as well. Does anyone do this on a platform that's not public?

## Sales for indie consultants is just riffing

Riffing is generative and fun generally but there's a way to bend this idea into revenue. As an indie consultant I don't do any outreach, I don't really do any content marketing (though I do plenty of content!) But the trick is that for an indie consultant "sales" can simply be riffing.
