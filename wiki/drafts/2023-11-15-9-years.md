Today[^well] is my 9th indie-versary, the anniversary of quitting my last full time job. Every year I write a set of reflections on how it's going, taking the time to reflect back

[^well]: Well, actually it's October 24th, but since having kids deadlines are a mere illusion, shadows of their former selves.

I ended last year's recap with this note:

> Iâ€™m going to pull myself out of this identity slump by sheer force of will. Watch me (tune in next year to see how that goes).

Oof. What a year it's been. Turns out I managed to do this but it took ALl. DAMN. YEAR. Honestly I was stuck for most of the year.

I tried a bunch of stuff (Figma Thinkers, SEO MBA live cohort) - trying new things on for size.

## First, the Highlights

* Roxy is 7.5 and full of a burning desire for independence and autonomy (where could she have gotten that from I wonder?!). This has at times made our home an us vs them environment of parents vs Roxy. Thankfully we're finding a much better balance in the second half of the year.
* Indy is almost 4 and really coming into his own with personality, pizazz and a love of building spaceships out of magnatiles (and he now has foam ninja swords that he uses liberally)
* Instead of putting the kids in summer camp we took an extended European vacation as a family. 
* I took three work trips and.. this was too much. The projects were *exactly* the kind of projects I want to work on, but I've got to find clients in NYC (or at least the east coast!) that I can work with in this capacity
* 

## The Numbers

The SEO MBA is back in balance with my consulting revenue at about ~30% of my consulting income.

## Stuck to Unstuck

In <em>Working Identity</em>, Herminia Ibarra argues that the process of transitioning from one career to another is both usually and <em>necessarily</em> messy and disordered, more like playing than like planning. During a transition, it can seem like nothing is happening, or too much is happening, or somehow both simultaneously. Often someone in the middle of a transition experiences a lot of pressure, both internally and from kin, to stop fucking around and get on with it. But that may be profoundly the wrong advice.

## The NEW MBA

After running the live cohort at the start of the year, the SEO MBA has mostly been on hiatus while I developed and launched the next iteration. It's a separate brand but definitely an evolution of the same idea: that
