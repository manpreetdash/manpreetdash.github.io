After consulting with ~40 companies across a wide range of industries and sizes, I ask the question: what have I observed about the most succesful companies?<br><br>
The answer is that the most successful companies have a key executive who is customer-centric: they have the a rich mental model for what customers want and how customers behave.

In the post I look at various ideas about what it means for a company to be customer-centric and how you might enable customer-centric thinking in executives.</div>

In contrast, 90 to 95% of what we build in AWS is driven by what customers tell us they want." - [Jeff Bezos](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm)

Recently I asked myself a question: after working as a consultant for 10 years, across some 40 companies: what makes some companies more successful than others? Is there anything I've observed that might predict success?

The answer I've arrived at, somewhat surprisingly, is that having a key executive being customer-sensitive is a key determining factor. I use the term **customer-sensitive** very carefully - not just customer centric or customer focused but customer sensitive - it's not that the executive needs to be *always* championing the customer, but that they have a deep mental model of the customers mindset, needs, pain etc. And that, when needed they can step into the shoes of the customer.

This has been validated by a few key consulting projects where I got to observe first hand a key customer-sensitive executive leave the company and the subsequent decline of the organization.

Interestingly - **every single company I work with would claim to be customer-centric**. Just like every company claims to be data-driven, it's become a kind of generic stance that companies adopt. But like the Jeff Bezos quote above, most companies don't actually walk the walk.

So, let's use the ðŸ‘Ÿ shoe emoji to represent the idea of stepping into the customer's shoes shall we?

## Neil Vogel is Customer Centric

This is an IAC trait I think. They have a 
Andy Berndt was magnificent at this. So is Neil Vogel. Both able to deeply channel the customer's perspective (while also being very savvy business thinkers too).

## Being Customer Centric is Unmeasurable

Amazon WBR has 100s of charts and graphs. But there's two exceptions:

<strong>The deck is primarily charts, graphs and data tables.</strong> Since there are hundreds of visualizations to review, written notes will bog the meeting down too much. Two notable exceptions to this rule are â€˜exception reportingâ€™, as well as the â€˜voice of the customerâ€™ anecdotes that customer service is allowed to insert into the metrics deck.

## Customer-centric? Let's get more specific.

Some things I've seen;
* Sensitivity to the market, how your company stacks up against the competitive landscape.
* Understanding the customer's motivations and pain points
* Anticipating customer behaviors
* Aesthetic taste for what resonates with customers
* Respecting the user - prioritizing things like respectful ads or fast loading site speed

## Learning Customer Centric Perspectives

Being customer centric requires building a mental model for who customers are, what they want and how they behave.

## Wardly Maps For Finding Customer-Centric Interventions

I've been starting to play around with Wardly Maps (on my remarkable tablet) and maybe this is a useful framework for identifying where in a business customer-centric thinking is most important: it's at the least commoditized areas. This is where the sensitivity is and the fewest norms, defaults and so on exist.

## Hospitality

Being customer-centric is a lot like hospitality. The folded napkin is an intangible benefit - you can't measure the impact but you can still care about it. Lots of little examples like this represent the ability to be customer-centric.
