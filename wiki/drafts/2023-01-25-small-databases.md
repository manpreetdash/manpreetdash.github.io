## Introduction

We've created excellent tools for managing specialist databases - the most obvious example is ecommerce stores. Uploading, managing, tagging, creating collections etc etc.

But there is a gap I believe in the tools between publishing "pieces of content" and "creating a database" that is worth exploring.



## Cybernetic Indexes

In an era of chatGPT, cheap search, web-crawlers and more.

Here's an example of a site I want to create:

Brooklyn artists. A complete database. Searchable and taggable. This doesn't exist today. How would you make it?

Interestingly one of the ingredients would be some kind of crawler - both for indexing a site to add to the database and for crawling existing sites to gather updated metadata etc. Web crawling and database maintenance of course are no easy tasks.
