title: How to Prioritize a Strategy Roadmap

Recently I've done a few consulting projects that look like a "business review" where I work with a team on strategy, but explicitly putting the whole business on the table as context. As I think about scaling up and formalizing this offering I've been thinking about where the value is for these sessions, what clients want, and where clients get stuck.

The format for these business review sessions today is:
- Initial exploratory kickoff to align on objectives
- Prep work to get up to speed with the quirks of the business and review existing data and documents
- Two-day workshop (in a remote world typically spread over 3-4 sessions)
- A summary presentation that captures the key ideas from the workshop

Given my background these sessions typically focus on growth, but the nice thing about expanding the frame from a typical consulting engagement is we deliberately put everything on the table: operations, process, people, funding etc. It's nice to try and look at the business as a whole so that when we get into the weeds with a particular channel or problem (which we inevitably do) we can keep the broader business context in mind.

It's surprising how useful this broader company context is - I get the impression that most leadership teams really don't give themselves permission to zoom in and out from the macro to the micro in the same session and this causes a lot of bad decision making.

The tension of course with these workshop sessions is that "strategy" and "roadmaps" are abstract concepts and not particularly useful. What can you accomplish in a two-day session that has real value for a client?

In my conversations with clients we often settle on "prioritization" as the output. As in we'll come out of the two days with "a prioritized roadmap" or a "set of strategic priorities".

But is prioritization really that useful?

## Prioritization sounds concrete but isn't actually that interesting

While clients often ask for a "prioritized roadmap" I don't think it's actually that useful. Clients already know roughly what to do, and the prioritization is often also fairly straightforward. Instead, there's typically some underlying feeling that what is currently on the roadmap won't prepare them correctly for the 18-month+ time horizon.

So then we dig a little deeper to explore the question "given belief X about the future, why are we not doing anything about it on our roadmap?".

THIS question starts to get a little more interesting - the first thing you realize is that we often don't have enough clarity around the 18-month future state. 

This in turn leads us to question the current state of the business in a new light. 

The first insight is that prioritization is often actually not that hard - clients roughly already know what they should be doing, and they roughly 



## Sequencing is more interesting & more useful

I think sequencing is more interesting and more useful

Here's an example output from one of these workshops with a business that sells online courses:

## Tradeoffs and Revealed Values

Revealed values are really important - especially in small teams. 

## Identifying the engagement trigger

Clients come to me with some broad ask "help us with our strategy" but it's often a specific trigger. Two that recently happneed:

1. A very small team hired a new full-time role so they suddenly had more resources. How should they deploy these resources? How should they evolve their business as a result?
2. A business feeling uncertain about the rise of chatGPT and how it impacts their business

Answering the specific question of course never feels very satisfying - partly because there are no answers. There is only a sense of understanding with clarity the situation and the opportunities.

An engagement trigger is a great way to situate the engagement (why now) and to ensure that at least one portion of the output points directly to this trigger.

## A sketch of an offering: Giving Clients New Ways of thinking


Ways for an exec team to upgrade their thinking - no one is going to buy that directly, but I think it's the secret job to be done for this kind of workshop.

So with that frame, and reviewing the previous work I've done and seeing where the most value is it typically comes in four ways:

1. Dashboards are a way of seeing more clearly how the business works
2. Sequencing is a way of thinking through tradeoffs
3. Narratives are ways to think through direction
4. Process and capabiliteis are a way to think through what's possible

Dashboards are ways of thinking: https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/05/06/executive-dashboards/








I think this is useful. But... I think perhaps the client 

Clients ask for prioritization, but in fact a formal sequencing or rigid roadmap are less useful than:

1. Relationships (if we do X, then it drives Y)

2. Assumptions & mental models (ah, but you don't need to merge these sites, you can )
e.g. "Google is comfortable with holding companies operating multiple sites for the same keywords"

3. Guiding principles / positioning ("Become the most trusted brand")

4. Models (if we improve conversion by X% then that's $YYYk in revenue)





## Summary

Ok, so if we accept the premise that strategy is a fluid, evolving thing - what is the most useful outcome from a moment-in-time intervention? For it to have enduring value I think it must allow us to think through situations we have not yet encountered. Which is why I focus the output on:
Dashboards
Sequencing
Narratives
Process and capabilities


Maybe after all the real value-add here is clarity. Clarity workshops.
