*Every year I write a reflection on the last year of consulting. This is a special issue, for reasons that will become apparent*.

In continuing hilarious fashion of being unable to predict the future I wrote in 9 years on the road:

*"I think I’ll be doing some version of consulting for the next 20 years."*

Ha, well.

October 24th, 2014 I quit Google and went out on my own. August 5th, 2024 I took a job. So this is a special 9.75 year update the last of these on the road posts (for a while at least).

I'll share more about what the future holds separately but in this post I want to celebrate and recap the journey so far.



Here's the story.




## Chartalicious - Let's Munch Some Data

Everyone loves some good charts so here's some data:

First, the aggregate view of 10 years of consulting:

Some notes:

* 2024 was my best year ever in absolute terms by a whisker, beating out 2018 as the previous best. And that only counts Jan-July!
* You can see how much the SEO MBA propped up some slow years in consulting 2022/2023.

And now for the more detailed view of the last 10 years (forgive the Google Sheets color formatting)

Some notes:
* April 2023 - April 2024 was a very long dry stretch for consulting.
* My longest running client was 2016 - 2024


## Half way through a 40-year career.

Will Larson is a bit of a role model for me - someone who's done plenty of time as both an independent and as a full time employee and blogged through all of it. In his great piece A 40 year career:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="A%20forty-year%20career." data-author="" cite="https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/">
<p>So as I pondered my father’s retirement, the question that caught hold of me was: How would I approach my work differently if focused on growth and engagement, and if I measured eras not in equity and IPOs but instead in decades? I’d focus on a small handful of things that build together, with each making the others more impactful as they compound over time.</p><p>I’d focus on pace, people, prestige, profit and learning.</p>

I'm about half way through give or take. And one thing I noticed about the last 12-18 months of consulting was a deceleration in learning. Consulting always has ups and downs but I felt a bit like.

So when the opportunity came up to go full-time with a consulting client where I knew the people and the learning would be rewarding I decided to take it. A change of pace, a change of environment. Let's see where the rabbit hole goes!
