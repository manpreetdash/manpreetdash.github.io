* Layoffs, AI and WFH have weakened the social contract between employers and employees - people don’t want to engage with a Professional Network. Meanwhile, social media is the new tobacco. People don’t want to engage with another Social Network.
* Instead, what if LinkedIn is a Learning network - a space for personal growth through genuine connection and communities of practice. This leverages LinkedIn’s unique advantage of real networks and real utility.
* This is a north star for everything LinkedIn does: from brand marketing to product development to new products.

There's three shifts in the world right now:

1. The employer / employee relationship is weakening
2. We're realizing that social media is bad for your health
3. Online education is *still* just getting started

Here's a proposal for a little big idea that would completely re-shape LinkedIn's brand and place in the world:

## LinkedIn, not a social network but a ***Learning Network***

Let's back up.

Here's the outline:

1. Changes in the world
    * The employer / employee relationship is weakening
    * Social media is bad for your health
    * Online education is *still* just getting started
2. Communities of practice
    * Communities are 
    * Learning is a doing word
3. A new brand for LinkedIn
    * The brand concept
    * How it comes to life across brand, product and marketing
    * Future product development
4. Summary & Conclusion


## 1. Changes in the World

### 1.1 The Employer / Employee Relationship is Weakening

People don't want to lean in, they want to sit down. Everyone everywhere tired all the time.

Summary: positioning LinkedIn as a *professional network* doesn't feel right in 2024.

### 1.2 Social Media

Summary: positioning LinkedIn as a *social network* doesn't feel right in 2024.

### 1.3 Online Education is *still* just getting started

Masterclass, Reforge, Maven, 

Summary: online education is going to become much bigger than it is

## Part 2: Communities of Practice

### 2.1 Learning Happens in Communities

> “Learning, in other words, occurs in communities, where the practice of learning is the participation in the community. A learning activity is, in essence, a conversation undertaken between the learning and other members of the community."


### 2.2 

## Part 3: A New Brand for LinkedIn

### 3.1 The Brand Concept: LinkedIn as a Learning Network

Learning is the one thing that your employer can't take away from you.

If anyone has the opportunity to come to the table with a fresh POV on the future of work it's LinkedIn. We need a new idea for what work can be that energizes people and also prepares for the biggest skills shift we've ever seen.

LinkedIn: not a social network, not a professional network - a learning network.

Why this works: Leverages LinkedIn's advantage of real networks and real utility.

It's good for everyone:

* Good for LinkedIn: stronger brand position
* Good for employers: employers who invest in employee learning do better: https://www.guild.com/why-now/
* Good for employees: a positive vision of social media and professional networking


### 3.2 How This Comes to Life

Brand marketing:
For employers: ways to show off their learning opportunities
For workers: provides positive ways to engage deeply with the LinkedIn platform
For gig workers: a reason to engage 
Recruiting product:
LinkedIn learning: 
LinkedIn Groups:
LinkedIn feed: anchored around curriculums

### 3.3 Future Concepts

This brand idea is cohesive across everything LinkedIn does *today* but what about future concepts? Here's five:

1. A new platform for L&D budgets, learning pathways and connecting the gap between learning and company L&D budgets.
2. Research and data on career paths (if I want to become a product manager, what do I do? If I want to work in climate tech what path could i take?)
3. Editorial focus on "how they got there" - less career dysmorphia and more transparency about the journeys people went on to get where they did.
4. A new approach to job ads that encourage companies to list "what you'll learn" as a core part of the job description
5. Supporting inclusive spaces for non-white, non-male thinkbros.
6. Instead of AI-generated UGC articles, how about AI-generated UGC curriculums. 
7. A platform like Reforge Artefacts that allows for the real texture of work to emerge (remember you own Slideshare right LinkedIn?)
8.

*About me: as an outsider to the corporate world I get to observe many different environments. And with a background in brand, product and education I can see how this might come to life in the world.*

> "If a man could only see himself as a younger man that grew" - Shirley Bassey


How this might come to life:
* Job postings that allow employers to highlight what you'll learn in your role
* Launching a new platform for employees to spend their learning budgets
* LinkedIn learning 2.0 with much stronger integration into the feed and your profile, with a focus on communities of practice
* Re-energized LinkedIn groups with a focus on communities of practice
* Brand marketing campaigns. LinkedIn. Not a social network, but a learning network.
* Re-invigorated SEO efforts - not community generated articles but community generated *curriculums*
* Reforge Artefacts

Here's a brand idea for LinkedIn. Make it all about learning.
