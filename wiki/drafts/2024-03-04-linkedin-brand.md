<div class="ttu black-50 pb2 b tracked" markdown="1">Summary</div>

* Layoffs, AI and WFH have weakened the social contract between employers and employees - people don’t want to engage with a Professional Network. Meanwhile, social media is the new tobacco. People don’t want to engage with another Social Network.
* Instead, what if LinkedIn is a Learning network - a space for personal growth through genuine connection and communities of practice. This leverages LinkedIn’s unique advantage of real networks and real utility.
* This is a north star for everything LinkedIn does: from brand marketing to product development to new products.

</div>

There's three shifts in the world right now:

1. The employer / employee relationship is weakening
2. We're realizing that social media is bad for your health
3. Online education is *still* just getting started

We need a new vision for work and LinkedIn is primed. Here's a proposal for a little big idea that would completely re-shape LinkedIn's brand and place in the world:

## LinkedIn, not a social network but a ***Learning Network***

Let's back up.

Here's the outline:

1. Changes in the world
    * The employer / employee relationship is weakening
    * Social media is bad for your health
    * Online education is *still* just getting started
2. Communities of practice
    * Communities are 
    * Learning is a doing word
3. A new brand for LinkedIn
    * The brand concept
    * How it comes to life across brand, product and marketing
    * Future product development
4. Summary & Conclusion


## 1. Changes in the World

### 1.1 The Employer / Employee Relationship is Weakening

People don't want to lean in, they want to sit down. Everyone everywhere is tired all the time. Gautam has an incredibly insightful series connecting work memes to employee engagement stats to take a close look at "what's going on" and the vibe shift in the world of work:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="The%20culture%20of%20work%20%7C%20(1%2F3)%20never%20not%20tired" data-author="Gautam Ramdurai" cite="https://snowbird.substack.com/p/the-culture-of-work-13-never-not?utm_campaign=post&showWelcomeOnShare=true">
<p>The final reason for our collective discontent is the <strong>dissonance between what we see in the economy and our lives.</strong> I am not here to debate if there is an actual connection in any of these examples - it’s about the perception that drives emotions of disengagement. In Vietnam, a booming economy didn’t translate into paychecks. The country’s economic gains haven’t been felt among the young - and housing has gotten worse. How is it that the S&amp;P in the West and Nikkei in the East have been smashing records but we’re yet to contain the layoff contagion? When Google laid off people last year, the biggest head-scratcher for my peers was ‘how could a company sitting on $100B in cash need layoffs?’ </p><p>It didn’t matter what the (however logical) explanation was, it made them change how they <strong>felt</strong> about their work.</p>

Summary: In a world of quiet quitting, positioning LinkedIn as a *professional network* doesn't feel right.

### 1.2 Social Media

Meanwhile, social media is the new tobacco. Last year the surgeon general issues a stark warning for social media companies about 

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Social%20media%20can%20put%20young%20people%20in%20danger%2C%20U.S.%20surgeon%20general%20warns" data-author="@NPR" cite="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/23/1177626373/u-s-surgeon-general-vivek-murthy-warns-about-the-dangers-of-social-media-to-kids">
<p>Social media can present a real risk to the mental health of children and teenagers because of the ways their brains are affected by the amount of time they spend using it, the U.S. surgeon general warns in a new advisory released Tuesday. </p>   <p>"Teens who use social media for more than three hours a day face double the risk of depression and anxiety symptoms, which is particularly concerning given that the average amount of time that kids use social media is 3 1/2 hours a day," the Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told <em>Morning Edition</em> host Steve Inskeep.</p>

Spoiler alert: it's not just about teens. We're all spending too much time on social media and while the effects are blended - we suffer the same downsides of depression and anxiety.

Summary: In a world of addictive social media, positioning LinkedIn as a *social network* doesn't feel right.

### 1.3 Online Education is *still* just getting started

Online education absolutely exploded in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. The subsequent pullback is *not* a bearish sign but merely a renormalization of growth. I believe we're still just getting started with online eduction.


Look at Masterclass, Reforge, Maven and more. We are living in an explosion of online education. But it's not just courses, it's real work examples (reforge artefacts), mentorship (https://adplist.org/), and more.


Summary: In a world where we're experiencing the biggest transformation of workplace skills ever - we're just getting started with online education.

## Part 2: Communities of Practice

### 2.1 Learning Happens in Communities

> “Learning, in other words, occurs in communities, where the practice of learning is the participation in the community. A learning activity is, in essence, a conversation undertaken between the learning and other members of the community."

This is the positive reframe of "networking". Networking is useful, but distasteful to many

> “In modern working life, professionals need to perform flexibly and independently in ever–changing environments. To be able to do this effectively, they depend on various lifelong learning skills, among others autonomous and self–directed learning.
> 
> As they are partly supported in their learning by interaction with their peers, an essential life–long learning skill they need to develop, is the ability to find and to connect with relevant others, i.e., professional networking.”
> 
> Rajagopal, K., Joosten-ten Brinke, D., Van Bruggen, J., & Sloep, P. (2012). Understanding personal learning networks: Their structure, content and the networking skills needed to optimally use them.

This is the north star for LinkedIn - to be a place where networks and learning come together into communities of practice.

### 2.2 

## Part 3: A New Brand for LinkedIn

### 3.1 The Brand Concept: LinkedIn as a Learning Network

Learning is the one thing that your employer can't take away from you.

If anyone has the opportunity to come to the table with a fresh POV on the future of work it's LinkedIn. We need a new idea for what work can be that energizes people and also prepares for the biggest skills shift we've ever seen.

LinkedIn: not a social network, not a professional network - a learning network.

Why this works: Leverages LinkedIn's advantage of real networks and real utility.

It's good for everyone:

* Good for LinkedIn: stronger brand position
* Good for employers: employers who invest in employee learning do better: https://www.guild.com/why-now/
* Good for employees: a positive vision of social media and professional networking


### 3.2 How This Comes to Life

Brand marketing:
For employers: ways to show off their learning opportunities
For workers: provides positive ways to engage deeply with the LinkedIn platform
For gig workers: a reason to engage 
Recruiting product:
LinkedIn learning: 
LinkedIn Groups:
LinkedIn feed: anchored around curriculums

### 3.3 Future Concepts

This brand idea is cohesive across everything LinkedIn does *today* but what about future concepts? Here's five:

1. A new platform for L&D budgets, learning pathways and connecting the gap between learning and company L&D budgets.
2. A new platform for companies to nurture and incubate communities of practice
3. Research and data on career paths (if I want to become a product manager, what do I do? If I want to work in climate tech what path could i take?)
4. Editorial focus on "how they got there" - less career dysmorphia and more transparency about the journeys people went on to get where they did.
5. A new approach to job ads that encourage companies to list "what you'll learn" as a core part of the job description
6. Supporting inclusive spaces for non-white, non-male thinkbros.
7. Instead of AI-generated UGC articles, how about AI-generated UGC curriculums. 
8. A platform like Reforge Artefacts that allows for the real texture of work to emerge (remember you own Slideshare right LinkedIn?)

## Conclusion

Here's something bananas. A performance improvement plan is a *negative* thing! WTF. Performance. Improvement. Plan. That's the thing you do so that you can fire someone right? No. Let's reclaim the performance improvement plan. It's a vision for personal growth and transformation **through work**.

Instead of learning coming last, what if it came first.

*About me: as an outsider to the corporate world I get to observe many different environments. And with a background in brand, product and education I can see how this might come to life in the world.*

> "If a man could only see himself as a younger man that grew" - Shirley Bassey

---

*An addendum for brands: for anyone feeling the vibe shift in the world of work everything above applies at the employer level too. You don't need LinkedIn to do anything to re-orient your employer brand around learning and growth. It's good for you and good for your people.*



How this might come to life:
* Job postings that allow employers to highlight what you'll learn in your role
* Launching a new platform for employees to spend their learning budgets
* LinkedIn learning 2.0 with much stronger integration into the feed and your profile, with a focus on communities of practice
* Re-energized LinkedIn groups with a focus on communities of practice
* Brand marketing campaigns. LinkedIn. Not a social network, but a learning network.
* Re-invigorated SEO efforts - not community generated articles but community generated *curriculums*
* Reforge Artefacts

Here's a brand idea for LinkedIn. Make it all about learning.
