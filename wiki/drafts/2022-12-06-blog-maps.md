I love a good diagram. So a while back I made a "blog map" for my website homepage that looked a bit like this:

But it was always a bit frustrating as a static image because it's not clickable.. But then one day I realized that you can actually build clickable diagrams using the magic of Figma, SVGs and CSS!

So, today checkout my new [clickable interactive homepage](https://tomcritchlow.com/).



Never been a more urgent need for connection, traversing the network (what twitter has been good for)

Where do you hang out online?

You can generate SVG using figma. But also code?

Maybe a YAML file that generates SVG using JS? Clickable links?

Maybe I can make the map alive?
- What if I put the sites in Gsheets
- Fetch RSS for each
- Lay them out on some kind of map
- Add a little red dot to ones that updated in the last week

This is similar to the blog gardens idea hmmm?!

In the map room - overhead projector and large paper to draw on
