I love a good diagram. So a while back I made a "blog map" for my website homepage that looked a bit like this:

But it was always a bit frustrating as a static image because it's not clickable.. But then one day I realized that you can actually build clickable diagrams using the magic of Figma, SVGs and CSS!

So, today checkout my new [clickable interactive homepage](https://tomcritchlow.com/).

The good news is that making these is super simple and easy! I'll walk through how to do that in a sec, but first some inspiration.

## Weirdo Bloggy Mappy Diagrammy Things

I'm a sucker for this kind of thing. Here's a few examples that I was inspired by along the way:

## How to Make One using Figma + SVGs + CSS

Making an SVG with clickable links is very easy. In summary:

1. Make a cool shape / visual / diagram in Figma
2. Add link to the shapes or text in Figma
3. Export the SVG
4. Embed inline SVG on your webpage
5. Style with CSS

That's it!

A couple of gotchas:

1) There are two options inside 




## Traversing the Map

Hey, here's a wacky idea. What if a bunch of us made these kinds of blog maps and then somehow wired them up together so that you could kind of walk across the map?

You know, auto-generating an SVG file from a database (ahem, a spreadsheet) wouldn't be that hard... Maybe there's a way to autogenerate some kind of map/web/diagram that spans a few sites at once?

And, for the motivated reader - once you have everything as an SVG you can style it with CSS and make it interactive with JS to your heart's content - so you if you want to show/hide or add interactions or movement to your SVG it's as easy as adding a few lines of javascript...!

If you make something fun - hit me up, I'd love to see it!
