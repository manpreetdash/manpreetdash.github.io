        <ol>
            <li class="pv2"><strong>Partners not clients</strong>. You can't outsource giving a shit but I try to really care about your business - and align my work to business impact not project deliverables.</li>
            <li class="pv2"><strong>What's the next most useful thing?</strong> Momentum is the most valuable resource and I work hard to unblock clients, always focused on moving things forward, even if that's hands-on work.</li>
            <li class="pv2"><strong>Yes! And...</strong> My consulting style is optimistic, generative and always seeking a way through. It's not about my ideas and right or wrong, it's about the best way forward together.</li>
            <li class="pv2"><strong>Strategy & stewardship</strong>. Too many consultants provide a pretty strategy presentation that's divorced from reality. I work hard to ensure we can connect the big picture ideas to tangible day to day work, and stick aorund to help with implementation and roll-out.</li>
            <li class="pv2"><strong>Numbers & narrative</strong>. I bring an analytical rigor to all projects but also recognize that how we position ideas and communicate projects changes their outcomes.</li>
