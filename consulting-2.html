            <li class="pv3"><strong>What's the next most useful thing?</strong> Momentum is the most valuable resource and I work hard to unblock clients, always focused on moving things forward, even if that's hands-on work.</li>
            <li class="pv3"><strong>Yes! And...</strong> My consulting style is optimistic, generative and always seeking a way through. It's not about my ideas and right or wrong, it's about the best way forward together.</li>

            <li class="pv3"><strong>Strategy & stewardship</strong>. Too many consultants provide a pretty strategy presentation that's divorced from reality. I work hard to ensure we can connect the big picture ideas to tangible day to day work, and stick aorund to help with implementation and roll-out.</li>
            <li class="pv3"><strong>Numbers & narrative</strong>. I bring an analytical rigor to all projects but also recognize that how we position ideas and communicate projects changes their outcomes.</li>

        <div class="flex">
            <div class="w-60-l">
                
            <p>Starting my career in SEO allowed me to get a deep, grounded understanding of "how the web works". Working at places like Google and consulting with companies of all shapes and sizes gave me a good understanding of "how business works".
                <br><br>
            Throughout my career I've been obsessed with the question of how to be effective. Recognizing that to be effective requires understanding the humans, the systems and the incentives at work.
            <br><br>
            I'm based in Brooklyn and love new opportunities.
