Careers only make sense in hindsight. And for indie consultants it's even worse - there are no well trodden paths. You have to kind of make it up as you go.

So I really love it when people show their messy, meandering careers. Three visualizations struck me recently:

## 3) Will Lethain

Will writes one of my favorite management blogs and posted this piece a while back exploring the idea of a [forty-year career](https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/):

<p>For both full timers and independents, career growth in a permissionless world is increasingly going to be a modular and iterative process vs the step-change enabled by the old world of gatekeepers.</p><p>So don’t wait for permission. If you’re unsure about the future of your career - don’t look for answers, don’t look for validation or labels - look for experiments, new networks and narrative air-cover. And remember that this networked permissionless world has enabled the opportunity to simply write your way into a new way of thinking and being</p><p>Big futures are permissioned.
