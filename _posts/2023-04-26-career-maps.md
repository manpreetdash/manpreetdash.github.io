title: What would a map of your career look like?
subtitle: It only makes sense in hindsight

I've been on a maps kick recently writing about [blog maps](https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/04/03/blog-maps/) and [roadmaps](https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/04/18/roadmap-territory/)! Let's talk about career maps...

Careers only make sense in hindsight. And for indie consultants it's even worse - there are no well trodden paths. You have to kind of make it up as you go.

So I really love it when people show their messy, meandering careers. Three visualizations struck me recently:

## 2) Michael Sklar

Michael Sklar [posted this great career map](https://twitter.com/michaelsklar/status/1649036269115121664) complete with paths NOT taken and pregnant with some great "maybes" for future possibilities:

## 3) Will Lethain

Will writes one of my favorite management blogs and posted this piece a while back exploring the idea of a [forty-year career](https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/):

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="A%20forty-year%20career." data-author="Will Lethain" cite="https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/">As you invest into your pace, the people you know, the prestige you build, the profits to fuel financial security, and your deep and broad learning, something magical starts to happen: each of these makes the others easier. This to me is the joy of a forty year career: things that seem hard early on become easy a decade in, and I can only imagine what it will look like two or three decades in.

## Permissionless Identities

All of these point to a kind of "career possibility space". Who could you become? I wrote a Little Futures essay on the coming age of permissionless identities that touches on careers, identities and more: 

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="LF10%20-%20Permissionless%20Identities" data-author="Tom Critchlow" cite="https://littlefutures.substack.com/p/lf10-permissionless-identities">
<p>For both full timers and independents, career growth in a permissionless world is increasingly going to be a modular and iterative process vs the step-change enabled by the old world of gatekeepers.</p><p>So don’t wait for permission. If you’re unsure about the future of your career - don’t look for answers, don’t look for validation or labels - look for experiments, new networks and narrative air-cover. And remember that this networked permissionless world has enabled the opportunity to simply write your way into a new way of thinking and being</p><p>Big futures are permissioned. Little futures are permissionless.</p>

## Navigating by an internal compass

One of my all time favorite Venkatesh posts fits this theme - how do you navigate a career, not by external factors but internal factors?

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="The%20Calculus%20of%20Grit" data-author="@ribbonfarm" cite="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/08/19/the-calculus-of-grit/">
If it isn’t crystal clear, I am advocating the view that if you find that what you are doing is ridiculously hard for <em>you, </em>it is the wrong thing for you to be doing.&nbsp; I maintain that you should <em>not </em>have to work significantly harder or faster to succeed today than you had to 50 years ago. A little harder perhaps. Mainly, you just have to drop external frames of reference and trust your internal navigation on a landscape of your own strengths.&nbsp; It may look like superhuman grit to an outsider, but if it feels like that inside to you, you’re doing something wrong.

So, two ideas to ponder:

1. How do you visualize your career past, present and future?
2. What logic have you used to navigate by and how might you navigate the unknowns of your career futures?
